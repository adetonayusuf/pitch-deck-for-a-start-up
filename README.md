## Investor Pitch Deck — Duvet Business
### Designed by Yusuf Adetona — Finance & Data Professional | Pitch Deck Specialist

### Project Overview

This investor pitch deck was created for a fictional company, Duvet Business, a global provider of customizable bedding solutions. The goal of the deck is to communicate the company’s value proposition, traction, business model, financial outlook, and growth strategy to potential investors in a visually compelling and structured format.

This deck demonstrates my ability to transform raw business concepts and financial insights into a clear, elegant, and investment-ready presentation—the same quality standard used in consulting, investment banking, and venture funding discussions.
